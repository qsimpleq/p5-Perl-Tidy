Perltidy TODO List
    This is a partial "wish-list" of features to add and things to do. For
    the latest list of bugs and feature requests at CPAN see:

    https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Perl-Tidy

  Improved Vertical Alignment
    There are still many opportunities for improving vertical alignment.

  Documentation
    A FAQ is needed to explain some of the more subtle formatting issues,
    and to give examples of different styles.

    The -formatter callback object documentation is incomplete.

  HTML writer
    The HTML writer does not colorize interpolated identifiers in here
    documents or quoted strings. The tokenizer outputs interpolation
    information for here docs; it still needs to be updated to do this for
    multi-line quotes. Then code needs to be written to scan for and markup
    identifiers.

Things which have been suggested but will not be done
  Recursive file processing
    A -r flag might be nice, but this is best handled by an exterior shell
    script.

  Make perltidy support the syntax of module XXX
    This generally won't be done unless the module is part of the core perl
    distribution because it is such an open-ended problem. Compounding the
    problem is the fact that perltidy often is invoked within an editor on
    small snippets of code, so it must to work correctly without seeing any
    particular 'use xxx' statement. Therefore, any syntax changes that
    conflict with standard Perl syntax can't easily be handled.

    However, an effort is being made to make perltidy generally more
    tolerant of extensions to perl syntax. Also, the pre- and post-filter
    capabilities of the Tidy.pm module may help.
